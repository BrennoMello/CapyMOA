## 📂 Repository Structure

```shel
.
├── experiments: folder containing the code/experiments
├── experiments/experiment_delay_ocl.py: the script that contains the configuration for running the experiments
├── data : folder containing the datasets
├── src: contains the code for the machine learning library CapyMOA
└── experiments/results_ER: folder containing all results and metric calculations
```

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-project.git (update after acceptance) 
cd CapyMOA
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable ".[dev,doc]"
```

## 📊 Data

We provide scripts to download and preprocess the dataset used in the experiments:

- **Raw data:** stored in `experiments/data.`
- **Metrics results for iterations:** stored in `experiments/results_{dataset}`.


## 🧪 Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model:

- `experiments/results_ER/ocl_plots.ipynb`: plot the graphs and calculates the metrics for OCL evaluation.
- `experiments/results_ER/ocl_plots`: all plots for test-then-train Online Windowed Accuracy.
